// added button and card functionality from React, using copypasta from https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/buttons/ and https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/cards/ for basic functionality and styling

// Feature 3: Bootstrap
// Why are we implementing this feature?
// As a user, I want to see a visually pleasing application that is also reponsive when I view this application on different screen sizes.
// What are we going to implement?
// Given that a user opens the application in the browser
// When the images are displayed on the screen
// Then each image should be rendered in a visually pleasing way: in columns, as screen width allows.
// How are we implementing it?
// Bring in the react-bootstrap library and use it to style your application making sure that it is responsive.
