// // Feature 1. Filter by Numbers of Horns
// Why are we implementing this feature?
// As a user, I want to be able to view the beasts by the number of horns
// What are we going to implement?
// Given that a user is presented with filtering options
// When the user clicks on one option
// Then the images should be filtered accordingly
// How are we implementing it?
// Using the Form component of react-bootstrap, build a drop down menu so that the user can choose to filter by number of horns.
// When the user chooses one of the options, the correct images should be displayed.

import React from 'react';
import Form from 'react-bootstrap/Form';
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';
import './HornForm.css';

class HornForm extends React.Component {

  // need a handleClick event handler here probably




  render () {

    return (

      // All the Form components go here




    )
  }
}



export default HornForm;
